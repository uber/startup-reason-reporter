# Startup Reason Reporter [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/uber/startup-reason-reporter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/uber/startup-reason-reporter)

The Startup Reason Reporter provides developers the reason that an iOS application has launched, or equivalently, the reason that the application terminated on the prior launch.

## Use

Usage is fairly straight-forward:


Swift:

```swift
// Determine whether the app crashed on a prior launch
let crashedOnPriorLaunch = ...

// Initialize a storage mechanism implementing UBApplicationStartupReasonReporterPriorRunInfoProtocol
let previousRunInfo: ApplicationStartupReasonReporterProtocol = ...

// Initialize the startup reason reporter
let startupReasonReporter = ApplicationStartupReasonReporter(notificationCenter: NotificationCenter.default,
previousRunDidCrash: crashedOnPreviousLaunch,
previousRunInfo: previousRunInfo,
debugging: false,
applicationState: UIApplication.shared.applicationState)

// Profit
let startupReason =  startupReasonReporter.startupReason
```

Obj-C:

```objc
// Determine whether the app crashed on a prior launch
BOOL crashedOnPriorLaunch = ...

// Initialize a storage mechanism implementing UBApplicationStartupReasonReporterPriorRunInfoProtocol
id<UBApplicationStartupReasonReporterPriorRunInfoProtocol> runInfo = ...

// Initialize the startup reason reporter
UBApplicationStartupReasonReporter *startupReasonReporter = [[UBApplicationStartupReasonReporter alloc] initWithNotificationCenter:[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter]
        previousRunDidCrash:crashedOnPriorLaunch
        previousRunInfo:runInfo
        debugging:[UBBuildType isDebugBuild]]
        applicationState:[UIApplication sharedApplication].applicationState;

// Profit
UBStartupReason startupReason = startupReasonReporter.startupReason
```

## Introduction

The UBStartupReasonReporter is based on the general idea that applications may terminate for a fixed set of reasons on iOS.  

Through process of elimination, the UBStartupReasonReporter can detect important events such as OOM crashes and app upgrades.  The full list of possible startup reasons is described below.

Critically, the reported startup reason is only as accurate as the the data that is provided to it.  For instance, some crash detection mechanisms may not encompass all forms of crashes, which may throw off the reported reason.

Our process for detecting various startup reasons is detailed by Ali Ansari and Grzegorz Pstrucha in this blog post: [Reducing FOOMs in the iOS app](https://code.facebook.com/posts/1146930688654547/reducing-fooms-in-the-facebook-ios-app/)

In order for detection to work, you must provide a class that implements prior run storage and conforms to UBApplicationStartupReasonReporterPriorRunInfoProtocol.  We provide one such class, backed by NSUserDefaults, in UBApplicationStartupReasonReporterPriorRunInfo, though you may also wish to implement your own version that is backed by your preferred storage mechanism.

Possible startup reasons are as follows:

```objc
UBStartupReason const UBStartupReasonDebug = @"debug";
UBStartupReason const UBStartupReasonFirstTime = @"first_time";
UBStartupReason const UBStartupReasonCrash = @"crash";
UBStartupReason const UBStartupReasonForceQuit = @"force_quit";
UBStartupReason const UBStartupReasonAppUpgrade = @"app_upgrade";
UBStartupReason const UBStartupReasonOSUpgrade = @"os_upgrade";
UBStartupReason const UBStartupReasonBackgroundEviction = @"background_eviction";
UBStartupReason const UBStartupReasonRestart = @"restart";
UBStartupReason const UBStartupReasonOutOfMemory = @"out_of_memory";
```

## Installation
#### CocoaPods

To integrate the StartupReasonReporter into your project add the following to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'StartupReasonReporter', '~> 0.2.0'
```

To integrate only the `UBApplicationStartupReasonReporterPriorRunInfoProtocol` protocol, but not the implementation, add the following to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'StartupReasonReporter/Core', '~> 0.2.0'
```

#### Carthage

To integrate the StartupReasonReporter into your project using Carthage add the following to your `Cartfile`:

```ruby
github "uber/startup-reason-reporter" ~> 0.2.0
```
